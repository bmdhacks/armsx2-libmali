/*
 * The tiler heap ring of the job-manager (v9) back half: MALI_JM_HEAP_SLOTS
 * growable GPU regions the tiler allocates polygon lists and vertex packets
 * from (mali_jm.h has the scheme). The driver owns the memory and writes
 * the Tiler Heap descriptor itself when it records, as Mesa's v9 gallium
 * driver does; there is no JIT allocation and no GPU job that sets the heap
 * up. What the heap must look like to the GPU:
 *
 *  - Size: the region's size; Base and Bottom: its start;
 *  - Top: the end of the first 2 MiB chunk, not the end of the region. The
 *    tiler allocates chunks from both the bottom and the top pointer and
 *    moves either on to a new chunk when its part is used up. A Top at the
 *    region's end would make the first top-side allocation fault at the
 *    region's last page, and a GROW_ON_GPF fault commits every page from
 *    the current commit up to the faulting one: the whole region.
 *    TILER_ALIGN_TOP with a 2 MiB commit and a 2 MiB growth step makes the
 *    kernel place the region so that start + commit is 2 MiB aligned, so
 *    start + 2 MiB is the end of the committed chunk;
 *  - word 0: Buffer, Tiler heap, 2 MiB chunks, dynamic partitioning (the
 *    genxml defaults, 0x329).
 *
 * The GPU moves Bottom and Top in the descriptor as it allocates, so the
 * passes of a batch that share one descriptor continue from each other, and
 * a command buffer that runs again gets the descriptor restored first.
 *
 * Slots are taken round-robin by batch, at record time; the dependency on
 * the slot's previous user is the queue's business at submit
 * (mali_jm_queue.c, heap_last_frag), so command buffers recorded on other
 * threads or submitted out of order stay correct.

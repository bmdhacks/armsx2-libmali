/*
 * Samplers, buffer views, descriptor pools and descriptor sets.
 *
 * A set is a run of 32-byte hardware descriptors in GPU memory, laid out
 * by its set layout (mali_descriptor_set_layout.h, panvk's layout). Every
 * descriptor is packed once, when the object it describes is created
 * (sampler, image view, buffer view); vkUpdateDescriptorSets only copies
 * those 32 bytes into the set, except for uniform and storage buffers,
 * whose Buffer descriptor is packed at the write. Dynamic buffers have no
 * slot: their address and range stay in the set's host memory and the
 * command buffer writes them, with the dynamic offset applied, into the
 * driver's resource table (table 0) at draw or dispatch time.
 *
 * Set memory is CPU-uncached and GPU read-only (the blob's descriptor pool
 * without dynamic bindings), so a CPU write needs no cache maintenance and
 * the GPU reads a set in place.

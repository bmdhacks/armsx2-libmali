/*
 * Graphics and compute pipelines.
 *
 * A pipeline holds references to its layout and its compiled shaders (it
 * keeps its layout and its shader binaries alive) and, for graphics, the
 * state the draw encoder needs:
 *
 *  - the pipeline's static state as a vk_dynamic_graphics_state (only the
 *    states the pipeline does not declare dynamic are set in it); the bind
 *    copies all of it into the command buffer only for pipelines with
 *    baked.uses_dynamic_state, and otherwise only what the draws read
 *    (mali_cmd_bind_graphics);
 *  - the bind block (struct mali_gfx_bind), what binds and draws read;
 *  - the hardware words the blob bakes at pipeline creation: TILER_FLAGS,
 *    DCD0 (occlusion query off and on), DCD1, DCD2, the Depth/stencil
 *    descriptor, and per render target the blend equation and mode.
 *    mali_gfx_pack_state() packs them from state; pipeline creation runs
 *    it with the pipeline's static state, and the draw encoder runs it
 *    again with the command buffer's state when baked.uses_dynamic_state
 *    says a dynamic state feeds them.
 *
 * Nothing here encodes a draw.

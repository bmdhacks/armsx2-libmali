 * Command buffers. Every vkCmd* writes its command-stream instructions
 * when it is recorded, with Mesa's cs_builder, into one stream per
 * subqueue; vkQueueSubmit only CALLs the recorded streams from the kernel
 * rings (mali_queue.c).
 *
 * Pools and the command-buffer objects are Mesa's runtime (vk_command_pool,
 * vk_command_buffer); this file set is the recording.
 *
 * Seam for render passes and draws: the vertex/tiler and fragment streams
 * exist in every command buffer (cs[MALI_SUBQUEUE_VERTEX_TILER],
 * cs[MALI_SUBQUEUE_FRAGMENT]) and are CALLed like the compute stream when
 * they are not empty; the subqueue context holds the tiler heap and
 * geometry buffer; barriers already handle all three subqueues;
 * mali_cmd_alloc gives descriptor memory; graphics descriptor sets are
 * bound into gfx.desc.

/*
 * The CSF side of a VkDevice and its VkQueue:
 *
 *  - struct mali_csf_device: per device. Scoreboard facts, the event
 *    thread that reads the kbase event channel, the queue group handle,
 *    and the kcpu queue. The state every frontend needs alike (the
 *    command-buffer slab cache, internal shader caches, the sync-object
 *    lock and condition, and device loss) lives on struct mali_device
 *    instead (mali_vk.h).
 *  - struct mali_csf_queue: per VkQueue. One kbase queue group with one CS
 *    queue (ring) per subqueue, the tiler heap, the GPU sync objects, and
 *    the submit counter.
 *  - struct mali_sync: the vk_sync type behind VkFence and binary
 *    VkSemaphore. A signal operation of submit N makes the sync "pending
 *    on N"; it is signalled once every subqueue has finished submit N's
 *    work, which each subqueue reports by writing N into its own "done"
 *    sync object in GPU memory.
 *
 * mali_sync.c and mali_wsi.c are mostly frontend-neutral; the few
 * operations that genuinely differ per frontend (whether a submit's work
 * has been reached, noticing a fault before the next event, and sync-file
 * import/export, how a host wait sleeps) are declared below as
 * MALI_PER_ARCH() hooks. This header has the v11 (CSF) bodies, defined in
 * mali_queue.c, mali_sync_file.c and inline below; the v9 (JM) bodies are
 * in mali_jm.h, mali_jm_queue.c and mali_jm_sync_file.c.

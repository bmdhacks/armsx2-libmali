/*
 * GPU timing of passes and dispatches on the job manager (v9): the
 * job-manager counterpart of timing.c (g57-backend.md §12).
 *
 * timing.c is compiled once, at this build's fixed CSF (v11) struct
 * mali_cmd_buffer layout and mali_cmd_alloc(); calling its functions with
 * a v9 cmd pointer would read cmd->measure, and allocate command memory,
 * at the wrong offsets. This file is therefore its own implementation of
 * the pieces that touch cmd directly (region allocation out of command
 * memory, cmd->jm.measure, the pending-submit queue), built at PAN_ARCH=9
 * against mali_jm.h's struct mali_cmd_buffer. Everything else -- struct
 * mali_measure_cmd / mali_measure_region, the configuration and output
 * writers in config.c, and mali_measure_harvest / mali_measure_collect in
 * timing.c -- is the one shared implementation both frontends call; none
 * of it touches cmd.
 *
 * Recording: a region is a System Timestamp Write Value job with the
 * header Barrier bit into the chain the caller names (mali_jm_cmd_write_value,
 * mali_jm_cmd_buffer.c): the open batch's vtc chain for a pass's
 * vertex/tiler side or a dispatch, the pass's current fragment segment
 * for its fragment side. The Barrier bit is what makes the timestamp wait
 * for every earlier job of that chain -- JM has no deferred-store
 * scoreboard to lean on the way the CSF design's STORE_STATE does, so the
 * ordering has to come from the job header itself (job-chain.md §6.1: the
 * blob sets the same bit on its own Write Value jobs).
 *
 * Reading: the same discipline as CSF (vkQueueSubmit queues every command
 * buffer that has regions on the device's pending list; a command buffer
 * being reset or destroyed reads its own regions first, since Vulkan
 * guarantees its work has completed), except "has this submission's work
 * finished" is the job-manager queue's completed_seq counter rather than
 * per-subqueue sync-object slots (mali_jm_measure_reached, mali_jm_queue.c
 * -- also called from timing.c's completed(), so a command buffer
 * measured from either frontend is read correctly by the one shared
 * mali_measure_collect).
